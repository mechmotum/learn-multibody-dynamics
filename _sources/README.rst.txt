Building the Website
====================

Clone the repository::

   git clone https://github.com/moorepants/learn-multibody-dynamics.git
   cd learn-multibody-dynamics

Install miniconda_ or Anaconda_ and create a conda environment for the book::

   conda env create -f multibody-book-env.yml

.. _miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
.. _Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Activate the conda environment::

   conda activate multibody-book

To build the website run::

   make html

When complete, the website is then viewable in your browser::

   <yourbrowser> _build/html/index.html

You can also run sphinx-autobuild (updates while while you edit) with::

   make autobuild

If you want to build one of the branches (for example a pull request), you'll
need to fetch and checkout the branch. First fetch down all the branches::

   git fetch origin

Then checkout the branch (this command is only need the first time you check it
out)::

   git checkout -b branch-name origin/branch-name

The branch name is listed on the pull request just under the title "...wants to
merge X commits into master from branch-name." Or you can find all branches
here: https://github.com/moorepants/learn-multibody-dynamics/branches

Now run::

   make clean
   make html

The ``make clean`` makes sure you don't keep any remnants from prior builds
around before building the new branch.

After you have a new branch setup you can switch between the master branch and
any branch name with just::

   git checkout master
   git checkout branch-name

If the master branch or any other branch has been updated on github you can
pull down the latest changes with::

   git checkout branch-name
   git pull origin branch-name

Editing Guide
=============

restructuredtext
----------------

The text is written in reStructuredText and processed with Sphinx. The `Sphinx
reStructuredText documentation page
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_ is a
good starting point to learn the syntax.

reStructuredText doesn't enforce a specific heading order, but this should be
followed for this text:

.. code:: rst

   =======
   Chapter
   =======

   Section
   =======

   Subsection
   ----------

   Subsubsection
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Autoreferencing is enabled so the above sections can be referenced with:

.. code:: rst

   :ref:`Chapter`
   :ref:`Section`
   :ref:`Subsection`
   :ref:`Subsubsection`

For equations and figures, they need to be manually labeled for numbered
referencing. Use these patterns:

.. code:: rst

   :label:`eq-my-equation-name`
   :math:numref:`eq-my-equation-name`

   .. _fig-my-figure-name:
   :numref:`fig-my-figure-name`

jupyer-sphinx
-------------

We use jupyter-sphinx to transform each page with code cells into a Jupyter
Notebook and Python script. Any page that includes ``.. jupyter-execute::``
directives will be processed in this way. The documentation for jupyter-sphinx
is here:

https://jupyter-sphinx.readthedocs.io

Xournal++
---------

I draw the figures, one per page, in Xournal++. The I export as -> svg ->
choose None for background and "current page" to get a single exported svg.

The SVG figures should be cropped to the bounding box of the drawn elements.
One can do so using Inkscape with these button presses: File -> Document
Properties -> Resize Page to Content. With Inkscape > 1.0 this command will
crop the figure:

.. code:: bash

   inkscape --export-type=svg --export-area-drawing ./my-figure.svg

Live rebuilding with sphinx-autobuild
-------------------------------------

`Sphinx autobuild`_ is a pretty good way to get almost instaneous rendered HTML
versions of the reStructuredText file. You can open a window with your text
editor and a window with your broswer side-by-side for almost instant feedback
on the formatting and Jupyter code execution.

.. _Sphinx autobuild: https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-autobuild

.. code:: bash

   sphinx-autobuild -b html . _build/html/

This is also encoded in the Makefile:

.. code:: bash

   make autobuild

Execute code cells in IPython while writing
-------------------------------------------
